While growth in Southeast Asia remains robust, data from the first half of 2019 indicates it has been slower than forecasted.

The impact of the Covid-19 crisis is hitting these economies through several channels.

the sharp drop in domestic demand due to lockdowns and other public health measures will have large multiplier effects on these economies, since consumption represents about 60 percent of GDP in the major ASEAN economies, with Singapore being an exception

At a minimum, we can expect to see a sharp slowdown or recession in all of the ASEAN economies in 2020

the worsening of economic conditions and the ongoing spread of the crisis has lowered forecasts by these international financial institutions (IFIs)
